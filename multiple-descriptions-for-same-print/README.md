# multiple descriptions different impressions of the same printed image

This directory contains two files:

- `withBMSatNumbers_multipleRecords.xlsx` - a spreadsheet with groups of LWL records that mention the same BMSat number (corpus described at James Baker & Andrew Salway (2019). Creation of the BMSatire Descriptions corpus (Version v1.0) [http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3245037](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3245037)) in either of the MARC 500 or 510 fields. For each record it gives the LWL number, details of where BMSat number was found, and where present the description from the MARC 520 field.
- `withBMSatNumbers.py` - the script used to make `withBMSatNumbers_multipleRecords.xlsx`. NB this code is not properly commented (yet).
