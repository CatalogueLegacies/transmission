In the center of the design, a monk tests the edge of an axe as he bends to over a horse-drawn sledge laden with instruments of torture, a statue of St. Antony, and a plan for a monastery at Blackfriars.

O'Connor (not caricatured), wearing leg-irons, stands at the bar; his hands are clasped, and he bends forward in profile to the left, making a confession which, though condensed, does not differ substantially from that made by him, McNevin, and Emmet, and published in the Report of the Secret Committee made to the Irish House of Commons on 21 Aug. ('Lond. Chron.', 27 Aug.),  ... 'I confess, that I became an United Irishman in 1796 & a Member of the National Executive, from 1796, to 1798. I knew the offer of French assistance was accepted at a meeting of the Executive in Summer 1796: I accompanied the Agent of the Executive (the late Lord Edward Fitzgerald) ...had an interview with General Hoche (who afterwards had the command of the expedition against Ireland) on which occasion every thing was settled between the parties with a view to the descent. ...

	[*  0.14 || 0.01 || 0.56 || 0.57  *]	Caroline and Bergami sit together in an opera-box, frowning angrily at the occupants of the pit, all men, who look up at the box disapprovingly. Bergami holds a bottle labelled 'Essence of Bergamot' and wears a braided hussar uniform. Caroline is very décolletée, with loose black curls and a four-cornered headdress. The Arms of the Republic of Genoa are on the wall beside them with a harp and musical score below. The front of the box is decorated with two cupids holding a ribbon.
	[*  0.12 || 0.01 || 0.36 || 0.36  *]	A scene from Tristram Shandy in which Susannah stands holdings her nose with her right hand while in her left she holds a candle over the cradle where the swandled infant Tristram lies with a plaster on his nose. She addressed the doctor with obvious fury, her mouth agape.  On the left Dr. Slop raises his left fist at her while in his right he holds a cataplasm in a ladle, ready to fling at her. His hat lies at his feet, and his wig is ablaze.  Obadiah stands behind him carrying in his hands a chamber pot and a bowl, a medicine bottle tucked under his arm. The two men stand before a screen.  The walls of the room are hung with portraits and a mirror; a grandfather's clock showing the time as 6:15 stands against the wall behind the cradle and Susannah. Two medicine bottles sit on a table partially hidden behind the screen. In the foreground lies an over-turned chair.
	[*  0.11 || 0.01 || 0.16 || 0.16  *]	"A burlesque of the trial of O'Connor at Maidstone (22 May), parts of the court being hidden by the large labels which issue from the mouths of prisoner and witnesses. The presiding judge (Buller) looks down with horror at the witnesses, the other judges are hidden. O'Connor (not caricatured), wearing leg-irons, stands at the bar; his hands are clasped, and he bends forward in profile to the left, making a confession which, though condensed, does not differ substantially from that made by him, McNevin, and Emmet, and published in the Report of the Secret Committee made to the Irish House of Commons on 21 Aug. ('Lond. Chron.', 27 Aug.), see BMSat 9244, &c. ... From O'Connor's pocket hangs a paper: 'The Press by O'Connor' [inflammatory organ of the United Irishmen, see BMSat 9186]. Round his neck is a noose of rope held by the hand emerging from clouds of the (invisible) Justice; in her right hand are equally balanced scales. The witnesses to O'Connor's character are speaking simultaneously. Four stand in the foreground in profile to the right, behind a barrier, looking towards the judge across a table. Fox (right), nearest O'Connor and the spectator, holds the book to his lips, his raised left arm thrust forward in a rhetorical gesture. ... From his pocket projects a book: 'Letters to Lord Ed F. M O'Connor &c &c.' (cf. BMSat 9244). Next stands Sheridan, with a sly expression, holding the book, 'Four Evangelists', his hat in his left hand; he testifies ... Next is Erskine, kissing the book, with left arm raised oratorically ... Next (left) is the Duke of Norfolk, kissing the book, his expression and attitude suggesting embarrassment. ... On the extreme left and behind Norfolk is Grattan. ... Among a crowd of other heads, chiefly hidden by labels, is one resembling Tierney. Above this phalanx of Opposition witnesses is a crowded gallery. Three counsel (the Attorney-General (Scott), Solicitor-General (Mitford), and (?) Garrow), who sit beneath the judges, are divided from the witnesses by a table covered with papers, &c, one being conspicuous: 'Charges of High Treason against Arthur O'Connor, Oliver Bond Dr McNevin.'"--British Museum online catalogue.
	[*  0.11 || 0.01 || 0.15 || 0.15  *]	"Four designs on one plate, separated by intersecting lines, each having a separate title, inscription, and border. [1] MODESTY! The Princess of Wales and Bergami seated together in an opera-box; the occupants of the pit, all men, look up at the box, shouting "Via! via! hiss hiss s s s." The pair frown angrily; Bergami holds a bottle labelled 'Bergamot' and wears braided hussar uniform. The Princess wears a Turkish turban, a very décolletée dress defines bulging contours. A cross on the wall with the inscription 'Republica Genovese' shows that the scene is Genoa. Below: "Her Modest looks a Cottage might adorn, Sweet as the primrose peeps beneath the thorn" ...  [2] DIGNITY! A scene in the Captain's cabin; the Princess and Bergami sit close together at a round table laid for dinner. She wears the same Turkish dress, which is now seen to have trousers. Both frown angrily at a naval officer who stands before them, hat in hand, saying: "I can recognize no power in you to enoble any one--and I shall not degrade myself & the Service by sitting at the table with such a fellow as that." Another officer stands by, and a midshipman walks off (right), exclaiming, "What will the larboard birth say to this?!!" "Grace was in all her steps, Heaven in her eye, In all her actions [sic] dignity"--[Milton on Eve.] ... [3] CHASTITY!-- The Princess, seated on a couch, embraces Bergami; both are dressed as before. Below: "-- Chaste as the Icecle, That's curded by the frost from purest snow, And hangs on Dian's Temple -- " ['Coriolanus', v. 3.]  [4] NATIONAL LOVE!-- A scene in the palace of Murat (Joachim, King of Naples), with Vesuvius seen through a window (right). The Princess, in her Turkish costume, walks with Pauline Borghese, their arms interlaced. She places a wreath on the bonnet rouge which decorates a bust of 'Murat' (left), which has grotesquely long moustaches. Pauline (as in British Museum Satires No. 10072) has the patched face which indicates a damaged reputation, and wears a dress of transparent gauze; she turns to take a letter addressed 'Principessa Paulina' from a leering Italian. Bergami stands close behind the Princess of Wales; behind, couples waltz. Below: "the loyalty, well held to fools, does make our faith mere folly"-- ..."--British Museum online catalogue.
