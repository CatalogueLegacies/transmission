Burke, seated next Topham, on whom he turns his back, holds out an empty plate towards Hastings on the opposite side of the table who keeps to himself a whole ham; they regard each other with wary suspicion. On Hastings's left sits Mrs. Hastings, also looking warily at Burke. She is decked with jewels and wears a small crowned turban as a head-dress. Next her is a man wearing a ribbon and star, drinking, who is identified as the Marquis of Buckingham *BRACKETED* . Opposite Mrs. Hastings sits a very fat lady talking to a lean man wearing epaulettes. They are identified as Mrs. Hobart *BRACKETED* *BRACKETED* and Col. Jekyll. Next Jekyll, Lord Sandwich and an ugly *BRACKETED* man share the same jelly-glass, holding between them the plate on which it stands. On the extreme right, on the farther end of the table, a man of plebeian appearance drinks from a tankard; he is identified as Dr. Parr. The man between him and Buckingham is identified as the Duke of Portland, whom he does not resemble. *BRACKETED* On the extreme left the Duke of Grafton turns towards the fat Mrs. Hobart *BRACKETED* . Opposite him a stout man drinking from a jelly-glass has been identified as Lord Nugent *BRACKETED* . Next him Cornwallis, wearing ear-rings, puts his arm round the shoulder of a lady, identified as Lady Clive, who looks languishingly at him as she takes a *BRACKETED* peach. Next her is Lord North. Opposite him is a man identified as Sir George Shuckburgh *BRACKETED* who takes his neighbour by the arm offering her a glass of wine; she demurs deprecatingly. On the farther side of the table, with no one seated opposite him, is the Prince of Wales, a fork held to his mouth *BRACKETED* , sitting impassively between Lady Archer and Lady Cecilia Johnston, two bedizened harridans, who ogle him, putting their hands on his shoulders. Next Lady Cecilia *BRACKETED* is Mrs. Fitzherbert, ogling Wilkes, who sits next her, squinting and leering. On the near side of the table is a man in back view wearing a ribbon and *BRACKETED* Lord Carlisle talking to Lord Heathfield who sits behind a sirloin of beef. Opposite him and on the extreme right is a pretty young lady identified as Miss Bingham. *BRACKETED* On the extreme left, on the near side of the table, a middle-aged couple, holding knives and forks, turn to each other with animated smiles. Opposite them sits a good-looking young man wearing a ribbon and star *BRACKETED* . On his left the Duke of Richmond turns with an expression of pained surprise to Lord Rawdon. Opposite this pair two stout men turn to each other, both drinking. The central group of this plate, a pendant to that of the Prince of Wales on pl. 2, is the Duke of York sitting between two pretty young women, his right arm is round the shoulder of one, probably Lady Tyrconnel, the other holds his left arm and shoulder; both look languishingly at him. On the near side of the table are two more couples: Lord Amherst *BRACKETED* puts an arm round the waist of a lean and ugly old woman wearing the fashionable false *TRANSCRIBED* in an exaggerated form. On the extreme right Lord Derby, his hand on his breast, drinks wine with the witch-like Lady Mount Edgcumbe. On the farther side of the table are two unidentified men, one of whom drinks from his plate; next him is a pretty young woman. On the extreme right Dundas turns to speak to his left-hand neighbour; he grasps a decanter and glass, spilling his wine. *BRACKETED* On the farther side of the table Philip Francis turns to speak to Dundas. Opposite him, and on the extreme left, a stout lady, identified as Lady Salisbury *BRACKETED* , sits in back view, her petticoats enormously inflated behind. She speaks to no one: Pitt, her right hand neighbour, leans behind the back of the Speaker *BRACKETED* to touch glasses with Fox, who smiles amiably, holding a decanter in his right hand. Cornwall bends avidly over his plate; he wears his Speaker's wig, the mace lies across his knees. Four figures sit opposite this group: the ugly Pepper Arden who gazes admiringly at a pretty young woman on his left; she appears displeased at her position between Arden and a fat woman who puts both knife and fork to her mouth. Next the latter is Lord Lansdowne, who seizes affectionately the hand of Lord Sydney who turns towards him with a smile; they drink to each other. Next Fox on the near side of the table a plain and elderly couple drink to each other; both are thin. They are identified as Lady Powlett and Sir H. Powlett. Opposite them, and, like the lady on his left, intent on his plate, is a military officer identified as General Bligh. His neighbour is old and haggard, her hair elaborately dressed. Next her and on the extreme right two men carouse together, both wear stars; one is identified as the Duke of Bedford, the other *BRACKETED* as the Duke of Norfolk *BRACKETED* . Opposite, a man wearing a ribbon pours out wine for an elderly and ugly lady who receives the attention with a gesture of satisfaction. They are identified as Sir George and Lady Yonge. He is identical with the ass whose profile is shown on the extreme right in BMSat 7318, who can hardly be Yonge who appears elsewhere in that print. 4 June 1788 Hand-coloured etching.

French troops march with fixed bayonets up St. James's Street, the houses receding in perspective to the gate of the Palace, which is blazing. In the foreground on the left and right are *TRANSCRIBED* and *TRANSCRIBED* . The former is being raided by French troops; the Opposition is in triumphant possession of the latter. In the centre foreground a *TRANSCRIBED* *BRACKETED* has been planted: a pole garlanded with flowers and surmounted by a large cap of *TRANSCRIBED* . To this pole Pitt, stripped to the waist, is tied, while Fox *BRACKETED* flogs him ferociously, a birch-rod in each hand. Between Fox's feet lies a headsman's axe, bloodstained; on it stands a perky little chicken with the head of M. A. Taylor *BRACKETED* . On the right is an ox, his collar, from which a broken cord dangles, inscribed *TRANSCRIBED* *BRACKETED* ; it is tossing Burke, goaded on by Thelwall, who holds its tail, and flourishes a document inscribed *TRANSCRIBED* *BRACKETED* . Burke flies in the air, losing his spectacles, and dropping two pamphlets: *TRANSCRIBED* , see BMSat 8788, &c, and *TRANSCRIBED* , see BMSat 8825. Behind the ox, Lord Stanhope holds up a pole to which is tied, by a ribbon inscribed *TRANSCRIBED* , the beam of a pair of scales; this is balanced by the body of Grenville, suspended by his breeches, and by his head, suspended by the hair; both drip blood. Stanhope, in profile to the left, looks up with a pleased smile; Lauderdale stands facing him, raising his arm to applaud. Behind is an advancing band of British Jacobins waving bonnets-rouges. Sheridan, with furtively triumphant smile, enters the door of Brooks's; a large porter's knot on his head and shoulders supports a sack: *TRANSCRIBED* ; under his arm is another: *TRANSCRIBED* . Beside the door *BRACKETED* stands a pestle and mortar inscribed *TRANSCRIBED* ; the mortar is filled with coronets. On the balcony above the door, Lansdowne, with his enigmatic smile, is working a guillotine; his left hand is on the windlass, in his right he holds up *BRACKETED* Loughborough's elongated wig; the purse of the Great Seal is attached to a post of the guillotine. On the left corner of the balcony rests a dish containing the heads of *BRACKETED* Lord Sydney, Windham, and Pepper Arden, *TRANSCRIBED* .

On the right corner of the balcony four men stand watching the guillotine with quiet satisfaction: Grafton, in profile to the left; Norfolk, clasping his hands, and Derby. Only the hat and eyes of the fourth are visible. In the club windows behind, staring faces are indicated. The lamp beside the door is crowned with a bonnet-rouge.

A grotesque and dwarfish drummer marches in front *BRACKETED* ; on his drum is the cap of Liberty and the motto *TRANSCRIBED* . He is immediately outside the door of White's, up the steps of which French officers with fixed bayonets are pressing; one tramples on a prostrate and bleeding body, another transfixes the throat of a member; behind are the hands of members held up to beg for mercy. Other soldiers have reached the balcony and are using daggers; they push over the bleeding body of the Duke of York, indicated by his ribbon and the dice-box and dice which fall from him. The Prince of Wales falls head first, the Duke of Clarence is about to be stabbed. From a projecting lamp-bracket beside the door hang the bodies of Canning and Hawkesbury, tied back to back. Their identity is shown by a placard: *TRANSCRIBED* . The *BRACKETED* lamp is surmounted by a broken crown.

On this a placard is speared: *TRANSCRIBED* The petitions of the four beasts in the front row are headed: *TRANSCRIBED* ; *TRANSCRIBED* ; *TRANSCRIBED* ; *TRANSCRIBED* ; *TRANSCRIBED* ; *TRANSCRIBED* ; *TRANSCRIBED* ; *TRANSCRIBED* . The canopied throne is raised on a dais of three steps, the footstool is a cushion supported on a *BRACKETED* elephant; but the King's feet are drawn back. His right hand is on his hip; he holds an oddly shaped sceptre in the left hand. The back of the throne is framed by carved mannikins with shackled hands and feet; a large crown rests on the heads of the two uppermost. The back of the canopy has a pattern of writhing serpents. Ministers, much caricatured, stand on the right and left of the dais. In the foreground *BRACKETED* and on the King's left, Wellington, with the apron and steel of a butcher *BRACKETED* , with gauntlet gloves and with a star on his tunic, holds a blood-stained battle-axe. Sidmouth, as Court-fool, sits in profile to the left on an apothecary's mortar, wearing a double-peaked fool's cap and a star, and holding a bladder which is his clyster-pipe. Behind is Eldon, scowling savagely and holding the mace and the Purse of the Great Seal. A bishop holding a crosier stands on either side of the throne, behind the Ministers. A staff supports an emblematical cask which a naked Bacchus bestrides. On the King's right is Liverpool, holding a tall staff to which a green bag is tied *BRACKETED* . Next him is Castlereagh, blandly sinister, holding a scourge, and with a bunch of keys hanging from his belt; he stares at the petitioners. A tiny Vansittart is beside him, in his Chancellor of the Exchequer's gown, with an *TRANSCRIBED* on his breast above a chequered pattern, hung diamond-wise. Immensely fat and absurd beefeaters stand along the back of the room under quasi-Gothic windows of stained glass. All hold tridents and turn their eyes towards the petitioners, grinning grotesquely. Each window is centred by an escutcheon on which a decanter is the chief object. The upper part of each is filled by a design of three large peacock's feathers *BRACKETED* . The Gothic roof, caricaturing that at Carlton House *BRACKETED* , is filled with tracery in the form of antlers.
