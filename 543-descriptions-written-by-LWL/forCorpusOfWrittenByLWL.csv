9620525	False	[]	True	True	[]	['1829', '1829']	1829	"Above the design: "Lord how this world improves as we grow older." A complicated design, foreground, middle distance, and sky filled with incidents, chiefly on applications of steam. In the foreground is a street-vendor's table spread with a white cloth and heaped with pine-apples, &c; beside it sits an elegant young woman reading a book, 'Sentimen ...', while a little boy holds over her a large pagoda-like umbrella, heavily fringed. A dustman gnaws a pine-apple, while his vis-à-vis, eating an ice, says "Vont you take a hice Joe." Beside it (left) is the tombstone of the 'Select Vestry', decorated with glass, knife and fork, and topped by a weeping cherub's head. On the right a steam-horse on a low-wheeled platform, on which are the necessary pipes, &c, careers forwards and to the right; the driver, dressed as a jockey, holds a steering-bar set in the creature's head; smoke pours from its nostrils; a huge smoking chimney, placarded 'The Steam Horse VELOCITY No Stopage on the Road', ascends from the tail. Behind the steersman sit four passengers: a lady in a riding-habit, a barrister in wig and gown, a well-dressed man, an Irish haymaker smoking a pipe. On the left is a little steam trolley beside which walks a woman crying 'Delicate Viends [sic] for your Quadrupeds'; on it is a basket of coal placarded 'Prime Cats Meat'. On the extreme left a footman in livery smoking a giant pipe (as in BM Satires No. 15604t) hands a letter to a flying postman, supported on webbed wings, who rings his bell, and has a pouch: "Two Penny Post". A man drives a lady in a light three-wheeled chair, worked by bellows and a propeller. A street-seller of 'Mutton Broth' walks before his huge steaming pan which rests on a wheeled platform with a funnel. A massive old-fashioned country wagon has a steam funnel and a steersman: "London & Bath in Six Hours". On the extreme right are adjacent open sheds; one contains a complicated mechanism where a top-boot is being brushed by steam; the owner sits on his portmanteau, waiting for them, while he puffs a cigar and reads the 'Gazette de France'. This is placarded 'Royal Patent Boot Cleaning Engine'; above: 'Puras Deus, Non Plenas, Adspicit Manus' [God regards only pure hands, not full ones]. The other is smaller and contains an engine to which is attached a huge razor, operating on the Duchess of St. Albans and placarded 'The St Al-ns New Steam Razor Patronized by her Grace' [cf. BM Satires No. 15654, &c.].   In the middle distance (left) are buildings. The Marble Arch (see BM Satires No. 15850), topped by a gibbet, which is placarded 'Designed to Elevate the Architects'; a man, smoking a cigar, kneels to adjust the noose. Behind is the east front of the Palace, with scaffolding and figures: on the dome, "the ball in the cup", see BM Satires No. 15669, a figure holds a trident, on the right a monstrous bird and a giraffe see BM Satires No. 15425). Next the arch is a 'Model for a new Church approved by the Mommitte [sic] of Taste': a fantastic neo-Gothic hybrid with a dome, topped by pillars supporting a platform, from which hangs a big bell, and on which squats a giant mandarin, with a clock-face on its belly, holding up two fingers and a lantern. The roof of the church is flat, covered with tombs, and edged with spikes for the protection of a cemetery, which is placarded 'This Church Yard is perfectly Safe' [see BM Satires No. 15777]; a coffin is being hauled up by a crane, apparently worked by steam. A smaller adjacent building (left) seemingly houses a furnace and steam-engine and is inscribed 'Kitchen'. The church abuts (right) on 'Greenwich Hill'; on this rests one end of a huge tube: 'Grand Vacuum Tube-Company Direct to Bengal' (a development of the Edinburgh-London tube of BM Satires No. 15075); this, receding in perspective, bridges an ocean, the other end resting on 'Bengal', where a tiny passenger steps out and clasps a welcoming Indian by the hand. Passengers on Greenwich Hill are about to enter the tube, where the back of a coach appears; a turbaned conductor shouts 'Now whos for Bengal'. An aperture or window in the tube shows passengers seated on an open coach or wheeled platform as in BM Satires No. 15075; women passengers wear monstrous hats. From the Bengal plain (right) a hill ascends on which rests the end of a bridge: 'Companys Suspension Bridge-To Cape Town'; a massive pier rising from the ocean contains a building: 'Restorateur' [sic]. On the water dividing England from India is a lady in a car harnessed to swans, as in BM Satires No. 11405 by Gillray. A big canopied passenger boat is drawn by a team of eight dolphins; the driver shouts 'Come up there'.  On a plateau behind Greenwich Hill is a wheeled steam-engine, like a giant watering-can with spout fore and aft gushing water: this is 'Mc Adams Newly Invented to lay the Dust he makes' [cf. BM Satires No. 15365]. On the sky-line a demoniac figure fires a mortar from which a blast slants across the sky inscribed 'Quick Conveyance for Irish Emigrants': tiny figures, one with a rake, are shot into the air to fall headlong.  Aerial travel is represented (1) by a platform supported at each corner by a balloon on which are soldiers and artillery (reminiscent of the French invasion fantasies of 1797 and 1803, see BM Satires Nos. 9220, 10029); (2) by an airship in the form of a whale-like monster with webbed wings, placarded 'For New South Wales'; raffish passengers of both sexes are seen through a window below which are the words 'with Convicts'. (3) A lady (right) sits between two propellers, steering a frail little machine drawn by a big kite (cf. BM Satires No. 15604!). On the left is a massive collection of cloud-borne castles, on which tiny builders are at work; placarded: 'Scheme for the Payment of the National Debt'."--British Museum online catalogue.

Influenced by an increasing fascination with American culture and a growing racism stemming from the abolition of slavery in England, the African American characters are depicted with grotesque features and manners, wearing outlandish clothes, and speaking in patois and malapropisms to be portrayed as ineptly attempting to mimic white high society. In this print the artist mocks African American vanity and the desire to look white: a well-dressed African American woman purchasing shoes at "Sambo Paley Boots & Shoe Manufacturer." The belle, portrayed with mannish features, wears a yellow bonnet with a white veil that frames her face like long straight hair. Seated, she slightly lifts her red dress to inspect the black shoe that the African American sales clerk has just placed on her large foot. She believes the shoe "is sich a bery dirty color" and does he not have any white or pink ones. The kneeling sales clerk attempts to persuade her that it may not be "handsome" to look at, but surely a "good color to wear." Another clerk with a row of boots behind him is seen in the background performing as a store sign states, the "Best Jet Blacking Sold Here." On the left, an African American couple is seen walking passed the store.

Britannia, wearing Roman dress with cothurnes, raises her arms, and shrieks (parodying Hamlet): "Doctors & Ministers of dis grace defend me!" The 'dis' is scored through but conspicuously legible. Addington holds a bottle of Gunpowder to her nose, and looks in alarm at the approaching army. He says: "Do not be alarm'd my dear lady! the Buggabo's (the Honest Gentlemen, I mean,) are avowedly directed to Colonial service, - they can have nothing to do Here - my Lady! - nothing to do with Us! - do take a Sniff or two, to raise your Spirits, and try to stand, if it is only upon One Leg!"

On the ground are many bottles, some on their sides, a basket of pineapples and limes (or lemons), and a row of large jars: 'Royal Punch 5 gal:', 'Sangaree 5 Gal:', 'Brandy', 'Rum' [on its side], 'Sangrorum 10 Gal' [extra-large and close to the sportsman]; also a much smaller jar of 'Water' [broken], and a number of empty bottles. In the middle distance a negro runs, driving birds towards the sportsman. Near him in the middle distance, a second sportsman reclines on a settee; a negress holds an umbrella over his head. The scene is a flat sunny plain, with distant hills. From British Museum online catalogue.
11998937	False	[]	False	True	[]	['1832', '1832']	1832	Adapted from a broadside published by J. Quick: The manager's last kick, or The distruction of the boroughmongers. "A crude, confused, and complicated design, the characters unrecognizable. William IV, riding 'The Good Old Grey'and accompanied by his Ministers, notably Brougham using the Mace as a broom, chases boroughmongers who fall head first into a pit (right), the 'Slough of Despond'. Russell, saying 'What do you think of my Purge now' , leads the "Grey", which snorts 'Reform'. The King: 'Begone you sad Rogues you have sat here long enough!!!' The ground on which they stand is 'Magna Charter'. The most conspicuous "Boroughmonger" is Sir R. Wilson in uniform with a kettle labelled 'A present from Southwk' tied to his coat-tail; he holds two papers: 'Lies against Bonaparte' and 'Queen's Trial'. Others include Wetherell saying 'I'm Again for Boroughbridge', Peel saying 'I'm Going to Tamworth'. Hunt's top-booted legs protrude from a blacking jar labelled 'Matchless for Impudence and Blacking!!!'. The members for Westminster try to save themselves, Hobhouse by clinging to the top of the pit, inscribed 'Westminster', Burdett by clinging to Hobhouse's coat-tails; in the latter's pockets are 'Catholic Bill' and 'Corn Bill'; he says: 'Holdfast Cam we are sure to get in again'. Other boroughs named, each with its doomed M.P. (represented usually by legs in air) are 'Newark: His Grace's Seat'; 'Newry', 'Penryn', 'Gatton', 'Old Sarum', 'Sudbury', 'Newport', 'Alderbury' [twice], 'Hedon', 'Corfe Castle'. O'Connell, waist-deep near 'New Sarum', holds up his arms to the Westminster M.P.'s, shouting, 'I'll join you Boys let's have a Union'. John Bull (left), obese and jolly, watches the doomed anti-Reformers, waving his hat and shouting 'Huzza! well done William!' Behind (right) is the façade of Bethlehem Hospital (Bedlam) with a lunatic waving from each window: 'No Reform'; 'Corruption for ever'; one of them is Wellington saying 'Its a Mistake'. They are 'The Bedlamites'.  Below are the verses of a street poet and "A Dialogue between John Bull and his Friend, Concerning the Row at the King's Theatre . . .".  The naive text is applicable to the election of 1831, not to that of 1832, but such street papers are without accuracy. The seventh of eight verses, contrasting William IV with George IV:  William is a Sailor bold sir,  And on the waves he has often roll'd, sir,  He wants no Marquesses wives or Daughters,  To spend his time at Virginea waters,  He goes to neither Parks or Races,  A slobbering ladies' pretty faces,  He guides the helm and keeps his station,  And knows what is wanted through the nation."--British Museum online catalogue.

12242189	False	[]	False	False	[]	['1833', '1833']	1833	A cat is hanging from a tree outside St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics in Old Street, London, condemned by a man dressed as a Quaker, with a tartan cloak. The on-lookers call him a 'Merry Andrew' (i.e. a person who amuses others by ridiculous behavior), believing him to be a resident of the building behind (renamed St Andrew's). The Quaker has a number of petitions and bills under his arm. Between 1830 and 1847 the M.P. for Wigtownshire, Sir Andrew Agnew, introduced four bills to the House of Commons attempting to enforce the better Observance of the Sabbath. On his third attempt Charles Dickens wrote 'Sunday Under Three Heads' (1836), a personal attack on Agnew, whom he described as a fanatic, motivated by resentment of the idea that those poorer than himself might have any pleasure in life. Agnew left Parliament in 1837, ending the campaign.
12242451	False	[]	False	False	[]	['1830', '1830']	1830	A collection of social satirical images, visual puns, and vignettes. Possibly a portion of one of Grant's frontispieces.
12242900	False	[]	False	False	[]	['1835', '1835']	1835	A series of unconnected caricature vignettes. The centre of the print is dominated by a large set of scales - a well-established symbol within the English satirical canon - which are weighted heavily towards the side containing 659 “£10 voters”, as opposed to the 36 well-dressed gentlemen of the “close packed corporation”. Beneath the scales a tubby gent in a bicorn hat tries to correct this imbalance by helplessly tugging at a rope. The multiple punning references to oaks are reinforced by the image of a dying tree stump, which Grant had given a human face, that looks miserably on from the background whilst a vulture, or some other bird of prey, circles above it menacingly. In the bottom left-hand corner two men, an undertaker and a man carrying the trappings of a pharmacist, stand in conversation. The apothecary, with a face that appears to be hideously scarred by smallpox; above stands a huge wheel of cheese, out of which crawls a figure. The rest of the print is covered by a motley collection of characters including 'Teddy the Mower' - a hobo who carries an official mace that's been turned into a scythe, 'Turn Again Dick' - A two-faced politician who advocates reform but also brandishes an article written for the Tory press, 'A German Duck' - A grotesquely overweight and featureless figure that has a dead bird hanging out of his coat pocket and the unnamed figure of an auctioneer. The print refers to the campaign for the 1835 general election campaign that began in Bury St Edmunds. The multiple references to 'oaks' relate to a prominent local banker by the name of James Henry Oakes, a staunch Tory supporter, who used his considerable wealth to pack the town Corporation with placemen who would deliver the policies he wanted. It is possible that the portly figure who is attempting to pull the scales back in favour of the “Close Pack'd Corporation” may be James Henry Oakes himself, although the character bears no resemblance to the 1839 portrait of Oakes held by the National Gallery. See British Museum online catalogue.

12860699	True	[]	False	False	['1749']	['1749']	1749	An allegorical representation of the nationalistic riot occasioned by a troupe of French comedians in London. This satirical print refers to the controversy and protest surrounding a French theatrical company, nicknamed the 'French Strollers', who applied for and were granted a licence to perform at the Haymarket in the winter of 1749. Their arrival occasioned much discontent; as the Scots Magazine reported, they were 'bitterly pelted in the news-papers'. Asserting their right to perform, they persisted in a show on 14 November, but were met by an audience intent on sabotage.  An eyewitness account of the incident appeared in the Monthly Review some years later (July 1761): 'People went early to the Theatre, as a crouded House was certain ... I soon perceived that we were visited by two Westminster Justices, Deveil and Manning. The Leaders, that had the conduct of the Opposition, were known to be there; one of whom called aloud for the song in praise of English roast beef, which was accordingly sung in the gallery, by a person prepared for that purpose;  and the whole house besides joining in the chorus, saluted the close with three huzzas! This, Justice Deveil was pleased to say, was a riot'.  Despite the Justice's assertions that the play was licensed by the King's command, the crowd had come prepared to produce disruption. They were equipped with instruments which they played discordantly as an accompaniment to their jeers, catcalls, and Francophobic songs: 'as an attempt at speaking was ridiculous, the Actors retired, and opened instead with a grand dance of twelve men and twelve women; but even that was prepared for, and they were directly saluted with a bushel or two of peas, which made their capering very unsafe'.  Unable even to dance, and following another abortive attempt by the magistrates to assert the King's authority, the curtain fell for the final time. The eyewitness evidently relished the outcome, venturing 'that at no battle gained over the French, by the immortal Marlborough, the shoutings could be more joyous than on this occasion'. The print embodies similar sentiments; the French strollers attack British theatrical establishment--represented by an affronted Britannia--who stands between them and British theatre-goers. In the foreground stands a perplexed Othello, lamenting the loss of his occupation, and an injured man a man lies on the floor 'Almost kill'd for not understanding French'.
